## üìÇ Project Structure

- **`assignment.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook for this assignment, which includes:
  - üìÑ **Markdown Cells**: Descriptions, explanations, and context for the problem.
  - üñ•Ô∏è **Code Cells**: Functional blocks implementing the solution or performing analysis.
  - üìä **Outputs**: Results of executed code for visualization or validation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>

2. Install Dependencies: Make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Create a virtual environment and install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt



## ‚ú® What I Used
  - üìù TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and Cosine Similarity 
  - ‚ö°  Latent Semantic Analysis(LSA)
  - üìà Best Matching 25(BM25)
  - ü§ñ T5-Bse LLM model was used to explore

## üìÇ Comparison of all the NON - ML Approaches

| **Method**       | **TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity**                                                                                      | **LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis)**                                                                                               | **BM25**                                                                                                  |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**       | Ranks documents based on the importance of words in a query and document.                                         | Captures latent topics in the data to improve semantic understanding of queries and documents.                                | Focuses on exact term matches and relevance, prioritizing documents with frequent query terms.         |
| **Best For**      | Simple queries, where exact word match and importance are key.                                                    | Understanding the meaning of queries in a broader context, even with different phrasing.                                      | Cases with a need for exact matches and fine-tuned relevance ranking for short or long documents.      |
| **Strengths**     | Easy to implement, quick, and interpretable.                                                                      | Captures semantic relationships, reducing reliance on exact word matches.                                                    | Handles relevance well, works effectively for keyword-heavy queries.                                   |
| **Weaknesses**    | Fails to capture semantic meaning and struggles with synonyms or paraphrased queries.                             | Requires computational resources and doesn‚Äôt work well with sparse or small datasets.                                         | Relies heavily on word overlap, which might ignore deeper context.                                     |
| **Results (ClearFeed Example)** | Found relevant documents but couldn‚Äôt rank nuanced matches well.                                             | Produced more meaningful rankings, with better semantic understanding of the query.                                           | Retrieved highly relevant documents and assigned clear relevance scores based on common terms.         |
| **Overall Preference** | Preferred for straightforward retrieval tasks when minimal preprocessing is needed.                              | Ideal when semantic understanding and broader topic matching are necessary.                                                  | Best when term frequency and ranking precision are critical.                                           |
